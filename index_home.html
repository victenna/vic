   <p>Date of Birth: 
    1946, Moscow, Russia.</p>
    <p>Education:</p> 
    <p>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (1964-1970), MSc in Electronic Engineering. He was awarded a Ph.D. in the field of electromagnetics and antennas.</p> 
    <p>Career Stages</p>
    <p>1.	For over two decades, from 1967 to 1990, he worked in the Research and Development department of a prominent Moscow-based scientific-industrial corporation. 
    During that time, he actively participated in the development of the first (in USSR) multielement passive type phased antenna array with electronically scanned beam. and smart adaptive antenna arrays. He achieved the rank of Senior Research Associate and taught the fundamentals of antenna array operations to students of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. He made presentations at all-union antenna conferences, including the A.S. Popov scientific session. Over his time at the company, he obtained about 30 patents (author's certificates). During his work on the antenna array development project, he was repeatedly awarded the status of the best employee of the company and the best company inventor. The results of published articles, as well as numerous patents contributed to the improvement of its characteristics. </p>
    <p>2.	Since 1995, he has been working in North America, specializing in antenna design for automotive applications. He developed keyless entry antennas with a range of over 100 meters for Chrysler and GM. The antennas were implemented into mass production. During this time, he also developed a microstrip antenna for satellite radio applications and printed-on-glass car antennas for AM and FM radio applications. All antennas are protected by more than 10 patents, as well as by 7 articles in scientific and technical journals such as Microwave Letters and IEEE Antennas and Propagation. During his tenure, two books were prepared and published: 'Automotive Antenna Design and Applications' and 'Antenna Arrays and Automotive Applications'.</p>
    <p>3.	In his retirement, Victor Rabinovich has been teaching children mathematics and the basics of Python programming. He created a website for children's programming education, pythonkidsgo.ca, which features over 60 practical Python projects using the Pygame library, as well as projects in Scratch. He has published books for children: "School Math Problems with Real-Life Applications," 2015, and "Python Lessons for Kids: Animation Projects with Turtle Graphics," 2021. Additionally, he manages a Facebook page titled "I like Scratch and Python coding."</p>
